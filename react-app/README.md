#### 7.6강 강의 후.마무리

1. Detail에 로딩이나 내용들이 아무것도 없다 (Home에 해줬던 로딩을 적용)
2. movie가 State에 있지 않다.(지금 API에서 json을 받아와서 아무것도 안하고 있다. console.log로 확인만한 상태. 그러니까 그 json을 State에 넣어주면 어떨까? 그럼 해당 페이지에서 상세 정보들을 보여줄 수 있다.)

-> state, setState, useEffect가 전부다. 이제 html 이랑 css가 전부이다.
-> props, propTypes도 배웠고 끝. 이게 멋진 앱을 만들기 위한 전부이다.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
